#Heart Disease Prediction API
This API is designed to provide users with a prediction of their likelihood of developing heart disease, based on relevant health data. By inputting certain metrics such as age, gender, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, users can receive an accurate prediction of their risk of developing heart disease.

#How to Use
To use this API, simply make a POST request to the appropriate endpoint (e.g. http://example.com/predict) with the relevant health data included in the request body. The API will then process the data and return a prediction in the form of a percentage likelihood of developing heart disease.

#Installation
To install this API, simply clone the repository from Github and run it on a local or remote server. The API is built using Python and Flask, so make sure you have these dependencies installed on your system.
