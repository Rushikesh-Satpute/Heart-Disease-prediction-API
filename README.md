# Heart Disease Prediction API :heart:
The "Heart Disease Prediction" API is a machine learning-based API that predicts the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on their symptoms. The API takes in several input parameters such as age, sex, chest pain, resting blood pressure, heartbeat rate, fasting blood sugar, maximum heart rate, and exercise-induced angina, and returns a prediction on whether the patient is likely to have heart disease or not.

## How to Use
To use the API, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/heart-disease-prediction-api.git

* Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Start the Flask server: python `app.py`

* Send a POST request to http://localhost:5000/predict with the input parameters. The API will return a JSON response with the predicted probability of the patient having heart disease.

## Installation
To install this API, simply clone the repository from Github and run it on a local or remote server. The API is built using `Python` and `Flask`, so make sure you have these dependencies installed on your system.
